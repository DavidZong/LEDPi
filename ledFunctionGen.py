## get math function from user as a function of time and generate an array with 1 ms resolution:
## functions in this family are sineGen(), squareGen(), triGen(), sawGen() and customGen()

## sineGen() accepts no parameters and outputs an array of values that define greyscale PWM values
## of a sine wave. This function should take user input of amplitude, period, min value and max value.
## the array this method generates should be one full period of a sine wave. 
def sineGen():
	print "Not Implemented Yet!"
	return []

def squareGen():
	print "Not Implemented Yet!"
	return []

def triGen():
	print "Not Implemented Yet!"
	return []

def sawGen():
	print "Not Implemented Yet!"
	return []

## customGen() asks the user to point it to a csv file that represents an array of PWM values. This csv
## can be anything. The csv must be 1 dimentional, and each cell represents 1 ms
